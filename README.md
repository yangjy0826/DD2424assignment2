<br />
The main task for this assignment is to train and test a n-layer network (fully connected layer) with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset based on MATLAB. You can refer to the "**Assignment2.pdf**" file for more detail. <br />
<br />
Because this is only a one layer network, the accuracy of classification is only around 40%. My result in detail is in the files "**DL_assignment2.pdf**" and "**DL_assignment2_bonus point.pdf**".
